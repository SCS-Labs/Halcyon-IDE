### Description
Halcyon IDE is the first IDE exclusively developed for Nmap Script developers. This project initially started as a free time coffee shop project. The original idea was to provide an easier development interface to information security community working on Nmap script development. The project was initially developed for personal use and later made the open source release with the community hoping to help like-minded nmap script developers.

## Features

- An IDE is certainly little more than normal text editor. Halcyon IDE provides a beautiful user interface that can highlight the source code syntactically and semantically and makes it easier for faster development.
- The side panel besides the workspace is easier to navigate through the important nmap files, especially the scripts, library, and data directories.
- The scanning options such as scan type, script arguments, argument file, packet tracking and other debugging settings can be configurable within the interface.
- The post development actions such as exporting the scripts into Nmap installation directory and updating script database is simplified in the interface.
